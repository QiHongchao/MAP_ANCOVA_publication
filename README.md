# MAP_ANCOVA_publication
 
The repository is used to store the R scripts and the JAGS models (stored in "./jags/") for the paper titled "Incorporating historical control information in ANCOVA models using the meta-analytic-predictive approach". Usages of the R scripts are as follows.

1. simulation_setting.R: the simulation settings. 
2. current_pooling_simulation.R: simulations for no borrowing and pooling.
3. map_simulation.R: simulations for the proposed multivariate MAP approach.
4. map_simulation_nocor.R: simulations for the proposed multivariate MAP approach without between-study correlation.
5. map_simulation_univariate.R: simulations for the proposed univariate MAP approach with common baseline effect and separate baseline effects.
