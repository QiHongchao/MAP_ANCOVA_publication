# MAP_ANCOVA_publication
 
The repository is used to store the R scripts and the JAGS models (stored in "./jags/") for the paper: Qi, H., Rizopoulos, D., & van Rosmalen, J. (2022). Incorporating historical control information in ANCOVA models using the meta-analytic-predictive approach. Research synthesis methods. (Link: https://doi.org/10.1002/jrsm.1561) Usages of the R scripts are as follows.

1. simulation_setting.R: the simulation settings. 
2. current_pooling_simulation.R: simulations for no borrowing and pooling.
3. map_simulation.R: simulations for the proposed multivariate MAP approach.
4. map_simulation_nocor.R: simulations for the proposed multivariate MAP approach without between-study correlation.
5. map_simulation_univariate.R: simulations for the proposed univariate MAP approach with common baseline effect and separate baseline effects.
